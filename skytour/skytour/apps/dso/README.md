# DSOs

There is a DSO model where you can store your own list of DSOs.

I've seeded this with ~900 DSOs down to roughly -30Â° declination.
* Messier
* Caldwell
* Herschel 400
* anything else that popped up in Stellarium with V < 12.

It has all of the expected fields:
* RA / Dec
* Mag
* Object Type (TODO: make a better list?)
* Angular Size
* Surface Brightness / Contrast Index (from Stellarium)

## Images

There's a model for uploading images (from HST, etc.).

There are also three other fields for images:

1. Finder chart - this was one where I put maps that I uploaded from the Internet, but they came from different sources, and largely weren't available.
2. DSO Finder chart - these are generated within this software, so they exist for all DSOs AND are uniform.
3. Field View - these comes from http://astronomy.tools --- you can customize it for your eyepieces and telescope, and it'll overlay them on scaled images from the PSS (so the view isn't likely to be close to the real world, but it DOES give you a good idea of scale).

## Priorities

Completely subjective.
