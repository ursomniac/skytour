<h2>Skytour</h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>This software is to help you:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Plan Observing Sessions</li>
    <li>Record/Log Observations</li>
    <li>Add Images Your Taken</li>
</ul>

<p>It is designed for observing in several ways (modes):</p>
<ul>
    <li>Naked-Eye</li>
    <li>Binoculars</li>
    <li>Small Telescopes (&leq; 6")</li>
    <li>Medium Telescopes (&gt; 6")</li>
    <li>Imaging ("Smart") Telescopes</li>
</ul>

<p>It comes with an extensive library of 
    several thousand Deep-Sky Objects (DSOs)
    and Solar-System Objects (SSOs).   You can
    add comets and asteroids.
</p>

If you travel with your scopes, you can add as many observing locations as you want.

<h3>How it basically works</h3>

<h4>Setting the Cookie</h4>
<p>Everything operates against a "cookie" where you set:
    <ul>
        <li>Your Location</li>
        <li>The UT Date/Time</li>
        <li>What Mode You'll be Using (mainly)</li>
    </ul>
The cookie sorts out "what's up when", including the location of the Planets,
and any Asteroids/Comets you've included.</p>

<p>Once set, you can:
    
    <ul>
        <li>See what's up right now at your location</li>
        <li>See what's up at the date/time of the cookie</li>
        <li>Create an Observing "plan" (for printing) - this
            is helpful if you're not going have laptop access
            while observing</li>.
        </ul>

<h4>Observing Sessions</h4>
<p>When you start a new Observing Session you can log every object you observe,
    as well as observing conditions (weather, sky brightness - if you have a light
    meter). Skytour keeps track of all that logging for you.  It you're using an optical telescope,
    you can also record the eyepieces and filters used.
</p>
<p>If you're using an imaging "smart" scope you can upload images of the objects you've
    observed.</p>
