<h2>Solar System Objects - SSOs</h2>
<p>
When setting the cookie all of the positions of the planets,
and targeted asteroids and comets will be calculated and stored.
</p><p>
    From there, you can look up any of these, and find them on the Skymap.
</p>
<h3>Planets</h3>
<p>
    Planetary positions and other metadata are calculated when a new cookie is generated.
</p>
<p>
    For the inferior planets, Mercury and Venus, their phases are also determined.
</p>
<h4>Planetary Moons</h4>
<p>All of the primary moons (and several of the brighter secondary moons) are
    stored and positions are calculated when the cookie is generated.
</p>
<h4>Other Planetary Features</h4>
<p>
    For Mars and Jupiter, the positions for Martian surface features 
    and Jupiter's Great Red Spot are calculated to see if they're 
    visible at the date/time of the cookie.
</p>
<h3>The Moon</h3>
<p>
The moon is also added to the cookie.  It's position is used with the "Real Time"
view for any DSO/SSO to show how far away an object is from the Moon in the sky,
if the Moon is above the horizon.
</p>
<h3>Asteroids</h3>
<p>
These are a subset of the full MPC Asteroid list - stored in the
`bright_asteroids.txt` file.   You can add to this for other asteroids,
and then use the Admin to put them in the "active" list.
</p>
<h4>Dwarf Planets</h4>
<p>
Pluto and the other dwarf planets are stored alongside the asteroids
if for no other reason than that their orbital elements used to calculate
their positions and magnitudes are in the MPC Asteroid database.
</p>
<h3>Comets</h3>
Likewise "active" comets have their positions calculated and brightest estimated
when a new cookie is generated.   The orbital elements are also 
pulled  <a href="https://www.minorplanetcenter.net/iau/MPCORB/CometEls.txt">
    from the MPC</a>.
</p>
<h4>Slight Bug</h4>
    <i>(This might no longer be an issue - it appears that Skyfield package
        now parses the MPC `comets.txt` file properly.)</i>
    <p>
If you download a new version of the file, you have to edit it to remove 
commas from the file:  the Skyfield package doesn't parse this correctly.
</p>
<p>It's a good idea to download updated version of this file every few months, 
    especially if a newly-discovered comet might become visible.</p>

<h3>Meteor Showers</h3>
<h3>Tracking SSOs</h3>
<p>
    From the navbar: <span class="nav-item op-sso">Track</span> will
    bring up a form that will "follow" the position of a Planet/Asteroid/Comet
    over the period of time requested and create a (somewhat crude) map
    showing the track over time.
</p>
<p>
    Needless to say, it performs less well if stressed. ðŸ˜Ž
