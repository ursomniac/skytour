<h2>Starting a New Observing Session</h2>
<p>
    Each Observing Session ("Run") takes place on a given night at a given location.
    
    <ol>
        <li>
        Navigate to <span class="nav-item op-ses">Session   ðŸ”½</span> 
        and then <span class="nav-item op-none"> Start New Session </span>
        </li>
        <li>Fill in the form.  Note that you're entering the <i>UT Date</i>
            (not local time)!
        </li>
        <li>Then the new session will appear under 
            <span class="nav-item op-none">Latest/Active Session</span>
            in the same drop-dropdown.
        </li>
        <li>If you then add new observations and/or observing conditions around the same 
            time as the Observing Date, the forms SHOULD populate any "Session" field 
            with the correct session (you can override this if you need to).
    </ol>
