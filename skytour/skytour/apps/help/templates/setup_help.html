<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<p>Once you've done the initial setup (generated the database and images) these
    steps will get things started.
</p>

<h3>Adding an Observing Location</h3>

<p>You'll need to define at least one observing location.
    For most users - who only observe from one location - this
    just sets important things like the latitude/longitude, but
    also can include information about sky brightness, Bortle rating, etc.
</p>
<p>To add a new Observing Location, you use the Django Admin.
    You'll need to be logged in, and your account has to be a superuser.
    You should have set this up when doing the initial setup; if
    not, use your Terminal app to go to the root Skytour directory
    (where `manage.py` is located) and run:
    <pre>
        python manage.py createsuperuser
    </pre>
    then log into the Admin (it will prompt you)
</p>
<p>
    You can add a new Observing Location 
    <a href="/admin/observe/observinglocation/add" target="_new">here</a>.
</p>
<h4>Observing Location Parameters</h4>
<h5>Primary Parameters</h5>
<ul>
    <li><b>Status:</b> this is "Active" although if you're scouting out several
        remove locations, you can alter the Status value accordingly:
        <ul>
            <li>Active: currently being used for observations</li>
            <li>Provisional: not Active, but under consideration</li>
            <li>Possible: "on record" but not being considered</li>
            <li>Issues: "checkout out" but with outstanding issues (nearby sources of lights, blockage by trees, etc.)</li>
            <li>TBD: other situations</li>
            <li>Rejected: tried out - not viable</li>
        </ul>
    <li><b>Name, Address, Time Zone:</b>: these are all self-evident</li>
    <li><b>Distance and Travel Time:</b>: helpful for remote locations; of course if 
        you're just observing from home, then "0" and "0"</li>
    <li><b>Latitude</b> in ° North - this is used for (among other things) calculating
        what Declination range is reachable from any location.</li>
    <li><b>Longitude:</b> in ° EAST (so North American users will have a negative longitude)</li>
    <li><b>Elevation:</b> not really used but might be helpful comparing across several locations</li>
    </ul>
    
<h5>Sky Brightness Metadata</h5>
    <p>
    You can get values for all of the parameters below for any location on the planet at the 
    <a href="https://www.lightpollutionmap.info/" target="_new">Light Pollution Map</a> site.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><b>Bortle:</b> from 1 to 9 - this is frequently mentioned on 
            social "astronomy" sites (or FB groups).  Handy to know - also
            helpful as a guide when considering remote locations.</li>
        <li><b>SQM:</b> the average dark-sky (no Moon) sky brightness
            overhead in magnitudes/arcmin<sup>2</sup>.</li>
        <li><b>Brightness:</b> ditto - measured in mcd/m<sup>2</sup></li>
        <li><b>Artificial Brightness:</b> ditto - measured in µcd/m<sup>2</sup> - the 
            estimation of artifical brightness to the sky brightness</li>
        <li><b>Ratio:</b> the artificial to natural brightness</li>
    </ul>
<h5>Maps</h5>
    <p>Three maps are stored (they're optional):
        <ul>
            <li>Google Maps (roadway version)</li>
            <li>Google Earth (satellite image with trees, etc.)</li>
            <li>Bortle Map (from the Light Pollution Map site, above)</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
<h5>Site Issues</h5>
    <p>Here you can add information about the site itself (all optional):
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Description:</b> self-explanatory</li>
        <li><b>Light Sources:</b> any on-site light sources to contend with</li>
        <li><b>Horizon Blockage:</b> trees, buildings, etc. and directions that 
            might limit what part of the sky you can observed.
            (See Location Masks, below for additional features about this.)</li>
    </ul>
<h5>Images</h5>
<p> Just a place to store images of the observing site, for your reference (optional)</p>

<h5>Observing Location Mask</h5>
<p>
    This (also optional) feature allows you to define the minimum altitude available for a range of azimuth.
    So, if you're observing from your yard, and the neighbor's house blocks some of the sky,
    of if there are significant trees in some direction, etc. you can define a "mask".
</p>
<p>How it's used in Skytour is in two places:
    <ol>
        <li><b>Skymap:</b> you can optionally overlay your mask on the star map.</li>
        <li><b>@Now and @Cookie:</b> this will filter out DSOs that are inconveniently
            placed based on the mask at the given date/time/location.</li>
    </ol>
<p>
    To enter this, you need to create a list of alt/az points (beginning and end).
    You'll want to use a compass to measure the azimuth and probably the "extended fist"
    method to estimate the altitude (for most people one "fist" = 10°).body

    Each line in the mask has the starting and ending azimith and altitude.
    If the two altitudes are equal, that's a straight line at that altitude; 
    if they're not it'll be a diagonal (so you can make things a little more complicated).body
</p>
<p>Typically, you want to start an azimuth at the ending of the previous one (so, e.g., 
    start = (90°, 30°) to end = (150°, 30°) to deal with the neighbor's house, followed
    by (150°, 0°) to (240°, 0°) for the next entry because you have a clear view to the horizon.
</p>
<p>
    You'll want to end using an azimuth of 360° so that you've completed the circle of azimuth.
</p>
<p>Click "Save" to Save.   If this will be your primary observing location,
    note the ID (in the URL of the page for the Location, e.g., "http://127.0.0.1:8000/observing_location/1" the
    ID = 1).    Then, if you haven't set the Site Parameter for this: do so
    under Site Parameter Positive Integer with the slug "default-location-id"
    and the ID under "Value".

<h3>Setting Site Parameters</h3>
<p>There are several tables in the database where you can customize Parameters
    and limits: some of them will pre-select options in forms, e.g., which telescope
    should be the default, what the default location ID is, altitude slew limits
    (for Alt/Az scopes), etc.

<h3>Observing Modes</h3>
<p>There are five observing modes:
    <ul>
        <li><b>N</b>: Naked-Eye = no equipment</li>
        <li><b>B</b>: Binoculars</li>
        <li><b>S</b>: Small Telescope (&le; 6" aperture)</li>
        <li><b>M</b>: Medium Telescope (&gt; 6" aperture)</li>
        <li><b>I</b>: Imaging Telescope (Seestar, Unistellar, Vaonis, etc.)</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>For any particular observing session you can choose any one of these.
    You can observe in any way you want, regardless of what's set,
    its function is to help in identifying potential objects for the
    selected mode: assigning suggested priorities, etc.

    Each DSO in the database is linked to the most-appropriate modes 
    for observing them, along with a "viability" (i.e., how difficult
    it would be to observe an object).
