<h2>Deep Sky Objects - DSOs</h2>
<h3>The DSO Catalog</h3>
<p>
Skytour comes seeded with a table of over 3,000 deep-sky objects.
</p>
<p>
This list is somewhat complete, in that it tries to incorporate objects 
in both with hemispheres down to approximately 13th magnitude, which 
should suffice for most small/medium telescopes as well as the imaging/"smart"
telescopes currently on the market.
</p>
<h3>DSO Fields</h3>
<p>
To avoid crowding and taking into consideration that in many cases 
more than one DSO can appear in a telescope's (wide) field of view,
there's a related "DSOInField" table of - i.e., over 2,000 additional DSOs that
are adjacent to (usually brighter) DSOs.  (So the total is just over 6,000.)
</p>
<p>
Thus going to a "DSO page", for example, M 106 the record contains not only the
bright galaxy, but also 3 other nearby galaxies.  In general, all the galaxies brighter
than magnitude 13.0 within ~45 arcminutes of the "primary" DSO will be included.
</p>
<p>
    <i>Occasionally</i> two adjacent objects might be held as separate records:
    for example, Caldwell 60 and 61 (the "Antenna Galaxies") have separate entries,
    even though their fields overlap.
</p>
<p>Using the Search box in the top navigation WILL scan both lists: in other words,
    searching for "NGC 4232" will return the page for "M 106" because the former is
    in the field of the latter.
</p>
<h3>DSO Metadata</h3>
Where possible each DSO has the following metadata:
<ul>
    <li>Coordinates (J2000)</li>
    <li>Magnitude (typically V band)</li>
    <li>Angular Size</li>
    <li>Surface Brightness (in mag/arcmin<sup>2</sup>)</li>
    <li>Distance (units vary based on scale)</li>
    <li>Object Type (galaxy, nebula, cluster, etc.)</li>
    <li>Morphological Type - varies by object type:
        <ul>
            <li>Galaxies - Shapley classfication, e.g., SAc</li>
            <li>Globular Clusters - Harlow/Hogg (from I to XII)</li>
            <li>Open Clusteres - Trumpler, e.g., II 2 r</li>
            <li>Dark Nebulae - Barnard opacity</li>
            <li>Bright Nebulae - Sharpless, e.g, 2 1 2</li>
            <li>Planetary Nebulae - Vorontsov-Velyaminov, e.g., 4+3a</li>
            <li>Orientation Angle - degrees E from N</li>
            <li>Contrast Index - obtained through Stellarium - not sure how to use it</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h4>Metadata Sources</h4>
<p>While the DSO and DSOInField models have fields for all of the above,
    seeding of the database tables pulls from SIMBAD and HyperLeda (mostly for galaxies).
    On display, the code tries them in the order HyperLeda, SIMBAD, and what in the Admin;
    you can override this to use just the Admin in the DSO records (on a case-by-case basis).
</p>
<h4>Object Types</h4>

<h3>DSO Observing Modes</h3>
<p>Each DSO (and it's associated "field") is assign one or more observing "modes"
    related to how appropriate it might be to different observing situations:

    <ul>
        <li><b>N</b>: Naked-Eye - objects that don't require optical aid to detect,
            presuming mostly dark (no Moon) conditions at a relatively dark location.
            Typically these objects will be 6th magnitude or brighter.</li>
        <li><b>B</b>: Binoculars - objects that are somewhat large (several arcminutes)
            and bright (< magnitude ~7.5)</li>
        <li><b>S</b>: Small Telescope - with aperture &le; 6" - objects down to about
            magnitude 11, or - in a few cases - fainter but with high surface brightness.</li>
        <li><b>M</b>: Medium Telescope - with aperture &gt; 6" - objects down to magnitude 12
            (sometimes fainter)</li>
        <li><b>I</b>: Imaging Telescope - mostly objects with magnitude < 15, but also
            excluding those with very small angular size - usually 2' in diameter, 
            however exceptions have been made for some even smaller objects - down to ~30'
            because post-processing of image stacks have been somewhat successful in 
            showing structure.</li> 
    </ul>

<h4>DSO Observing Priorities</h4>
<p>For each mode assigned a "priority" has been set:
    <ul>
        <li><b>0</b> - Lowest - almost not worth attempting</li>
        <li><b>1</b> - Low - doable, but not likely to be especially interesting</li>
        <li><b>2</b> - Medium - less well-known, generally smaller or fainter or 
            unlikely to show much detail</li>
        <li><b>3</b> - High - definitely worth attempting</li>
        <li><b>4</b> - Highest - the "must see" objects on anyone's list</li>
    </ul>

    <p>These are all arbitrary.</p>

    <p>On many pages, the Imaging Mode Priority is shown (encircled number with color)
        to make it easy to scan lists if you're using an imaging/"smart" telescope.
        For the other modes, the format is the priority value and label, 
        e.g., "3 - High".
    </p>

 <h4>DSO Observing Viability</h4>
 <p>In addition, there is also a "viability" assigned to each mode for a DSO.  These
    range from 0 to 10, and crudely (and arbitrarily) say how difficult it would be
    to observe (or even detect) an object:

    <ul>
        <li><b>0</b> - Not Viable</li>
        <li><b>1</b> - Unlikely Viable</li>
        <li><b>2</b> - Extreme Difficulty</li>
        <li><b>3</b> - (Very)) Difficult</li>
        <li><b>4</b> - Challenging</li>
        <li><b>5</b> - Requires Patience</li>
        <li><b>6</b> - Generally Visible</li>
        <li><b>7</b> - Usually Easy</li>
        <li><b>8</b> - Easy</li>
        <li><b>9</b> - Very Easy</li>
        <li><b>10</b> - Extremely Easy</li>
    </ul>
 </p>
 <p>Of course, what's Easy for a larger telescope might be impossible in Binoculars,
    so it's important to keep the observing mode in consideration.</p>
