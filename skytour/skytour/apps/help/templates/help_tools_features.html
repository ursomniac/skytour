<h4>Zenith Finding Chart</h4>
<p>
    This generates a custom star map for a few degrees away from Zenith for
    a given location + date/time.   This map has stars labeled with their
    magnitudes, so that you can use it to get a better estimate of limiting
    magnitude.
</p>

    It's located under the <span class="nav-item op-ses">Session  ðŸ”½ </span> dropdown,
    at <span class="nav-item op-none">Zenith Finding Chart.</span>.
