## Seeing and Transparency

### Seeing

There are several different scales in use.   Most assume equipment that isn't what amateurs have.


| Value | Description | Arc Sec (8" aperture) |
| ----- | ----------- | --------------------- |
|   1   | Boiling image without any sign of diffraction                        | &gt; 6.67"    |
|   2   | Eddy streams in the central disk; (partly) missing diffraction rings | ~4.13 - 6.67" |
|   3   | Central disk deformations; broken diffraction rings                  | ~1.67 - 4.13" |
|   4   | Light undulations across diffraction rings                           | ~0.67 - 1.67" |
|   5   | Perfect diffraction pattern                                          | &lt; 0.67"    |

#### Qualitative scale: http://www.handprint.com/ASTRO/seeing3.html, Bruce MacEvoy ©2016
* The "Airy disk" is the evenly bright, round disk, bordered by a dark interval, at the center of an undistorted star image at high magnification (diagram, above).
* "Diffraction ring" is a thin, concentric band of light around the Airy disk, which in an undistorted star image is separated from the disk and from other diffraction rings by a dark interval.
* Oscillation ("dancing") refers to random angular shifts or jumps of the star diffraction artifact; oscillation is caused by large amplitude turbulence (usually near the ground or inside the telescope or observatory).
* Scintillation ("speckling") refers to rapidly churning or boiling beads of light separated by dark intervals; scintillation is caused by high energy turbulence (usually at high altitudes and due to local weather or the jet stream).
* "Flashing" is a sudden expansion, defocus and loss of detail in a star image, often accompanied by a brightening in the surrounding diffusion nimbus; at low magnification it appears as brief spikes or flares emanating from the star image. Flashing usually only occurs in very poor seeing.

##### Rating Criteria
1. SEEING F - 	Uniform speckle cloud. The Airy disk is entirely obscured by speckles. The whole star image resembles a compact globular cluster, not of stars but of small and rapidly moving speckles. The star image is bloated, diffuse and is not brighter at the center; flashing is often present even though dancing can be minimal or entirely absent. The severity of turbulence within this level can be judged by the frequency or "churn rate" of speckles, by the angular size of speckles and dark diffraction intervals (they become smaller and churn more rapidly in more extreme turbulence), by the extent of dancing or flashing, and by the angular diameter (inflation or bloating) of the star image.
2. SEEING D - 	Recognizable Airy disk. The Airy disk is recognizable but lacks a continuous dark interval border. The Airy disk is often badly distorted or obscured by speckles: the dark interval around the disk is absent or only briefly forms a border arc. Diffraction rings are absent, appearing as speckles instead, but the dark diffraction gaps between speckles are large enough and moving slowly enough to be clearly visible. Dancing is often in excess of 3 Airy disk diameters and flashing can occur. The severity of turbulence within this level can be judged primarily by the proportion of time that the Airy disk appears as a distinct bright area at the center of the star image, by the proportion of time that the first dark interval appears as the clearly defined edge of the Airy disk, and by the frequency of dancing that exceeds 3 Airy disk diameters.
3. SEEING C - 	Distinct and continuous Airy disk. The Airy disk is undistorted and separated from surrounding speckles or arcs by an unbroken dark interval. The Airy disk is circular; the first diffraction ring appears as speckles or broken small arcs and secondary rings are continuously broken. Flashing is usually absent, and dancing displacement is mostly within a circular area 1 to 3 Airy disk diameters wide . The severity of turbulence within this level can be judged primarily by the proportion of time that the first diffraction ring forms large arcs, by any deformation in the Airy disk, and by the occurrence of dancing that exceeds 2 Airy disk diameters.
4. SEEING B - 	Distinct first diffraction ring. The Airy disk is surrounded by a continuous first diffraction ring. One or more secondary rings may be visible in bright stars but these are more frequently broken into arcs. Flashing is entirely absent, and the dancing displacement is within 1 or 2 disk diameters (that is, within the area spanned by the secondary diffraction rings; see diagram above). The severity of turbulence within this level can be judged by the proportion of time that the first diffraction ring is unbroken, and by the proportion of time that the second or third diffraction rings form semicircular arcs.
5. SEEING A - 	Undistorted diffraction pattern. The complete diffraction artifact of Airy disk and two or more diffraction rings is clearly and continuously visible. The Airy disk is perfectly round; the first and second diffraction rings are motionless or briefly shimmer but do not break into arcs. Dancing and flashing are entirely absent. The telescope reaches its full resolution potential. The relative amount of turbulence within this level can be judged by the proportion of time that the diffraction artifact appears motionless or by the proportion of time that the seccondary diffraction rings are unbroken.

#### Another qualitative scale:

* Altitude zones:  1 (overhead) 2, 3, 4 (closer to the horizon) in ~20° bands
    * nothing is twinkling:  "possible 5" - check with telescope
    * Only zone 4 twinkling:  "4, possibly higher"
    * Zone 3 twinkling: "3"
    * Zone 2 twinkling: "2"
    * Everything twinkling: "1"

### Transparency

We're using SQM instead of visiually estimating limiting magnitude.
