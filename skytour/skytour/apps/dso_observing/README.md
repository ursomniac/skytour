# DSO Observing

## DSO
For now use all DSOs in the db.

### Status
We can turn things off or mark them "needs review", and publish lists based on that.

## Observing Modes
* N = Naked Eye:  this object can be seen with the naked eye
* B = Binoculars: this object can be seen with binoculars
    * Assume 10x50
    * Assume on a tripod
* S = Small Telescope: this object can be seen with a small telescope
    * Aperture < 8"
    * limiting magnitude - generally V = 10
* M = Medium Telescope: this object can be see with a medium telescope
    * Aperture 8-12"
    * limiting magnitude = generally V = 12
* I = Imaging Telescope: this object is best suited to imaging
    * Pixel Size: ~1.0-1.5"
    * Aperture >2"
        * Exposure times will vary quite a bit
        * I suppose that we could determine exposure time, probably not worth it

Note that there will be overlap in these!   For example, M 33 can be seen by all five modes, though the experience will be very different.  On the other hand, the Hyades
or Mel 111 is so large that there's no point in telescope observations.

## Observing Viability
For a given mode, there's also the question of viability that affects the experience.  While this is affected by conditions (light pollution, seeing, etc.) it basically 
comes down to "is it worth it to attempt this object at all"?

This might be better as a scale, I think, say 0-10 along the lines of:

* 0 = not viable: was considered but just not doable
* 1-3 - probably not viable, challenging for experienced observers
    * 1 = experienced observers, great conditions, with luck
    * 2 = experienced observers, great conditions
    * 3 = experienced observers 
* 4-6 - viable - might require good conditions or patience
    * 4 = generally requires great conditions
    * 5 = feasible but not particularly easy most of the time
    * 6 = feasible under decent conditions
* 7-9 - not just viable but "easy"
    * 7 = feasible most of the time
    * 8 = easy to find
    * 9 = very easy to find
* 10 = extremely easy even for inexperienced observers

## Observing Priority
This is a subjective scale similar to the ones assigned to DSOs:

* 0 = None
* 1 = Low
* 2 = Medium
* 3 = High
* 4 = Highest
