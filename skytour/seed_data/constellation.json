By the time the MUL.APIN was created&mdash;by 1000 BC&mdash;modern Aries was identified with both Dumuzi&#39;s ram and a hired laborer.

He further argues that the original name of Hercules &ndash; the &#39;Kneeler&#39; (see below) &ndash; is a conflation of the two Babylonian constellations of the Sitting and Standing Gods.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The earliest Greek references to the constellation do not refer to it as Hercules.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aratus\" title=\"Aratus\">Aratus</a>&nbsp;describes it as follows:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Right there in its [Draco&#39;s] orbit wheels a Phantom form, like to a man that strives at a task. That sign no man knows how to read clearly, nor what task he is bent, but men simply call him On His Knees&nbsp;<em>[Ἐ&gamma;&gamma;ό&nu;&alpha;&sigma;&iota;&nu;&nbsp;&quot;the Kneeler&quot;].</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now that Phantom, that toils on his knees, seems to sit on bended knee, and from both his shoulders his hands are upraised and stretch, one this way, one that, a fathom&#39;s length. Over the middle of the head of the crooked Dragon, he has the tip of his right foot. Here too that Crown [Corona], which glorious Dionysus set to be memorial of the dead Ariadne, wheels beneath the back of the toil-spent Phantom. To the Phantom&rsquo;s back the Crown is near, but by his head mark near at hand the head of Ophiuchus [...] Yonder, too, is the tiny Tortoise, which, while still beside his cradle, Hermes pierced for strings and bade it be called the Lyre [Lyra]: and he brought it into heaven and set it in front of the unknown Phantom. That Croucher on his Knees comes near the Lyre with his left knee, but the top of the Bird&rsquo;s head wheels on the other side, and between the Bird&rsquo;s head and the Phantom&rsquo;s knee is enstarred the Lyre.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The story connecting Hercules with the constellation is recounted by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dionysius_of_Halicarnassus\" title=\"Dionysius of Halicarnassus\">Dionysius of Halicarnassus</a>:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On his way back to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycenae\" title=\"Mycenae\">Mycenae</a>&nbsp;from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iberia\" title=\"Iberia\">Iberia</a>&nbsp;having obtained the Cattle of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geryon\" title=\"Geryon\">Geryon</a>&nbsp;as his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Twelve_Labours\" title=\"The Twelve Labours\">tenth labour</a>&nbsp;Heracles came to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liguria\" title=\"Liguria\">Liguria</a>&nbsp;in North-Western&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy\" title=\"Italy\">Italy</a>&nbsp;where he engaged in battle with two giants,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alebion\" title=\"Alebion\">Albion</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bergion\" title=\"Bergion\">Bergion</a>&nbsp;or Dercynus.

As snakes shed their skin every year, they were known as the symbol of rebirth in ancient Greek society, and legend says Asclepius would revive dead humans using the same technique he witnessed. Although this is likely the logic for Serpens&#39; presence with Ophiuchus, the true reason is still not fully known. Sometimes, Serpens was depicted as coiling around Ophiuchus, but the majority of atlases showed Serpens passing either behind Ophiuchus&#39; body or between his legs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In some ancient atlases, the constellations Serpens and Ophiuchus were depicted as two separate constellations, although more often they were shown as a single constellation.

However, this posed the problem of how to disentangle the two constellations, with Deporte deciding to split Serpens into two areas&mdash;the head and the tail&mdash;separated by the continuous Ophiuchus. These two areas became known as Serpens Caput and Serpens Cauda,&nbsp;<em>caput</em>&nbsp;being the Latin word for head and&nbsp;<em>cauda</em>&nbsp;the Latin word for tail.</p>", "historical_image": "historical_constellation_maps/hist_SER.jpeg", "center_ra": 16.950666666666667, "center_dec": 6.122, "area": 636.928, "neighbors": [5, 9, 27, 40, 49, 59, 75, 72, 86]}}, {"model": "utils.constellation", "pk": 77, "fields": {"name": "Sextans", "abbreviation": "SEX", "slug": "SEX", "genitive": "Sextantis", "map": "constellation_maps/SEX.gif", "other_map": "", "description": "<p><strong>Sextans</strong>&nbsp;is a minor&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_equator\" title=\"Celestial equator\">equatorial</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation\" title=\"Constellation\">constellation</a>&nbsp;which was introduced in 1687 by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Hevelius\" title=\"Johannes Hevelius\">Johannes Hevelius</a>.

One of the oldest depictions shows the bull standing before the goddess&#39; standard; since it has 3 stars depicted on its back (the cuneiform sign for &quot;star-constellation&quot;), there is good reason to regard this as the constellation later known as Taurus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The same iconic representation of the Heavenly Bull was depicted in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendera_zodiac\" title=\"Dendera zodiac\">Dendera zodiac</a>, an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt\" title=\"Egypt\">Egyptian</a>&nbsp;bas-relief carving in a ceiling that depicted the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_hemisphere\" title=\"Celestial hemisphere\">celestial hemisphere</a>&nbsp;using a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planisphere\" title=\"Planisphere\">planisphere</a>. In these ancient cultures, the orientation of the horns was portrayed as upward or backward. This differed from the later Greek depiction where the horns pointed forward.&nbsp;&nbsp;To the Egyptians, the constellation Taurus was a sacred bull that was associated with the renewal of life in spring. When the spring equinox entered Taurus, the constellation would become covered by the Sun in the western sky as spring began.
