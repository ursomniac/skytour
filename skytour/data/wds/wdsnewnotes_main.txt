                       to the measured separation of 0".50 is r = 0.32 = q/(1+q). Hence, the   .

                       discovered by Miller & Preston (1964 PASP 76, 47), it took several      .       
                       years to derive the first orbit from radial velocity data (Evans 1989   .

                       argued by Evans and by Evans et al. (2000 AJ 120, 407), because the     .

                       for the Cepheid). They estimate the companion mH = 9.6 +/- 0.3 mag      .

                       major axis on the order of 0.1" or 1.5 au. Assuming a mass sum of 2     .       
                       Msun, the orbital period should be around 1.3 yr; in fact, two orbits   .       
                       with periods 1.19 yr and 2.38 yr were published by Eggen (1956). This   Egg1956 
                       binary should be an easy target for speckle interferometry at 4-m       .       
                       telescopes. It was observed 10 times from 1976.9 to 1980.7 with         .

                       The star is well studied. Two statistical surveys of binaries within    .       
                       25 pc consider it to be single (Duquennoy & Mayor 1991; Raghavan et     Duq1991 
                       al. 2010). Heintz & Borgman (1984) state that measures cannot be        Rag2010 
                       fitted by any orbit and conclude: "Although this alleged visual binary  Hei1984i
                       (ADS 3701) has three published orbits, it is probably spurious".        .

                       periods from one to two years with high confidence. Data with lower     .       
                       precision show a constant RV of +21 km/s over many years (Duquennoy &   .       
                       Mayor 1991; Abt & Willmarth 2006; Raghavan et al. 2010). The star is    AbH2006 
                       located about 1m above the main sequence, supporting the thesis of an   .       
                       equal-component binary. If the orbit is seen face-on, the RV variation  .       
                       would be small, especially if the components are of equal brightness    .       
                       (blended lines move in opposite directions, the centroid stays          .       
                       constant). However, the lines in this star remain narrow and the        .       
                       speckle non-resolution during 3.8 yr firmly excludes a face-on orbit.   .       
                       Remember that 104 Tau is bright (no identification errors possible)     .       
                       and that the components are supposedly equally bright, hence easy to    .       
                       resolve by speckle. If this star is single (as everything seems to      .

                       by other observers. WDS catalogers assume an factor of 2 error and      .

                       passage after 1890 are doubtful. The recovery observations made by      See1896d
                       See, Douglass, and Cogshall at Lowell Observatory from 1896.668 to      Dgl1896 
                       1896.695 were taken in the morning shortly before sunrise when Sirius   Cog1896a
                       was low in the sky. See notes that the mean position angle of 220 deg   .       
                       at 5.10" is about 30 deg behind its predicted location and the sep      .       
                       sep is larger than expected based on previous orbit fit. Aitken and     A__1896d
                       Schaeberle reported measurements between 1896.814-1897.027 made from    Shb1897a
                       Lick Observatory at a significantly different mean position angle of    .       
                       189 deg and 3.7". Both Aitken and Schaeberle comment that neither of    .       
                       them saw a star at the position reported by Dr. See. Following the      .       
                       contradictory reports, Stimson J. Brown  published observations from    Brs1896 
                       his logbook that were taken earlier in March 1896 at the USNO. The      .       
                       position angle is similar to the values reported by Aitken, but the     .       
                       separation is about 1" larger. Brown notes that the observations were   .

07374-3458 FIN 324     f Pup. It was resolved as 0.2" binary FIN 324AB in 1954.31 by Finsen    .       
                       (1956) using double-slit interferometer at the 0.7 m Innes refractor.   Fin1956a
                       The components were comparable in brightness with dm from 0.3 to 0.6.   .       
                       Finsen published 7 mean positions resulting from 25 nights (the last    .       
                       one in 1960.26). His measures show considerable scatter; the motion     .       
                       looks erratic rather than regular. Finsen could not resolve AB since    .       
                       1960.29, despite repeated attempts. However, on 1963.305 he found       .       
                       another companion C at 0.52" with dm =0.8. In fact W. van den Bos saw   Fin1964a
                       both companions earlier and measured AB and AC simultaneously in        .       
                       1956.2 and 1959.7 (van den Bos 1957, 1961). AC was measured later by    B__1957b
                       R.H. Wilson, Hipparcos, and various speckle interferometers. All        B__1961a
                       speckle observations show no trace of the subsystem AB, except the one  .       
                       on 1989.305 where B looks doubtful and much fainter than C (McAlister   McA1990 
                       1990). No trace of B was seen at SOAR in 2008-2011 (4 speckle runs).    .       
                       AC follows a Keplerian orbit with 81 yr period (Hartkopf et al. 2012)   Hrt2012a
                       which was slightly corrected here using the latest measure. This        .       
                       excludes confusion between the companions (i.e. B and C being the same  .       
                       star). Besides, both were measured concurrently by van den Bos.         .       
                       The companion B cannot be real. The closest separation of AC is 0.09"   .       
                       according to the orbit and excludes any sub-system with comparable      .       
                       separation because such a triple star would be dynamically unstable.    .       
                       The fact that the orbit of AC is known does not allow us to explain the .       
                       apparent non-hierarchical configuration by projection. If B were real,  .       
                       its orbital period would be on the order of 10 yr (scaling from the     .       
                       orbit of AC) and it would have shown up in our speckle data. Like 104   .       
                       Tau, we have here a binary which actually is not binary, but a ghost.   Tok2012b

                       42910, BD-20 2665). It was targeted at SOAR for the first time. To our  .       
                       surprise, the object turned out to be a resolved triple, with the       .

                       32mas separation corresponds to an orbital period of ~2yr. However,     .       
                       the separations in the y and I filters are somewhat discordant;         .

12177-6410 JNN  79     The two targets 2MASS J12173945-6409418 and J12174012-6409389 are       .       
                       physically bound, as shown by common proper motion analysis. However,   .       
                       this means that one of the targets likely has an error in the Riaz et   .       
                       al. (2006) spectral type determination, since J12174012-6409389 is      Ria2006 
                       classified as M2 but is fainter than J12174012-6409389, which is        .       
                       classified as M3.5. The fact that J12174012-6409389 is fainter holds    .       
                       true both in 2MASS and in the AstraLux images. Both components are      .       
                       resolved as close binaries with AstraLux, so we consider it a strong    .       
                       candidate for a quadruple system, with J12173945-6409418A as the        .       
                       primary. Concerning which spectral type determination is incorrect, we  .       
                       consider that it is more likely that J12174012-6409389 is mis-          .       
                       classified, as the flux ratio to the close companion is closer to       .       
                       unity than in the J12174012-6409389 case. We thus set the spectral      .       
                       type of J12174012-6409389A to M3+/-1, and determine the other spectral  .

18467-0916 JNN 118     The primary star has two candidate companions in the field of view.     .       
                       The fainter candidate C is most likely a background star, since its     .       
                       color is entirely inconsistent with a late M-type star. The brighter    .       
                       candidate B is more uncertain. It's colors are fully consistent with    .       
                       the brightness contrast to the primary for a physical companion,        .       
                       implying a spectral type of M5. It is also visible in 2MASS (Skrutskie  .       
                       et al. 2006 AJ 131, 1163), which enables to perform a rough CPM test.   .       
                       The test indicates that B is inconsistent with a static background      .       
                       object, again implying physical companionship. However, the motion is   .       
                       also poorly consistent with orbitalmotion, with a sky-projected speed   .       
                       of order 2 au per year - highly unlikely for such a wide and low-mass   .       
                       binary. This implies either under-estimated uncertainties in the data,  .       
                       or an unusual astronomical coincidence. With the small separation and   .       
                       relatively high brightness difference of the candidate companion, it    .       
                       is just at the detection limit of 2MASS, and is only reliably           .       
                       detectable in K-band. Perhaps there is a systematic noise component     .       
                       beyond the quoted astrometric 2MASS error in this circumstance. If all  .       
                       the data are taken at face value, another possible interpretation is    .       
                       an unfortunate chance alignment with a local M-dwarf, which has a       .       
                       signficant proper motion of its own. In any case, due to all these      .       
                       uncertainties, we tentatively treat the pair as a candidate binary      .       
                       here, but emphasize that more data is needed to test physical           .

                       An astrometric orbit was deduced from Hipparcos data by Jancart et al.  Jnc2005 
                       (2005). The period derived for the visual orbit matches both the        .       
                       spectroscopic and astrometric solutions within the uncertainty, and     .       
                       other orbital parametrs are in reasonable agreement with the Tokovinin  .       
                       solution. The updated Hipparcos parallax (39.98 +/- 0.73 mas),          .       
                       combined with the orbit, yields a mass sum of 2.0 +/- 0.3 Msun. The     .       
                       composite spectral type is K3V; a magnitude difference of 0.8 mags      .

                       AD: Baranov (1909) measured new companions at (303deg, 29.2", V=7.8)    BnW1909 
                       and (343deg, 160.8", V=9.5), in addition to a measure of the AB pair.   .       
                       The wide pair was added to the WDS as H 2 26AD, but the 29" pair was    .       
                       apparently ignored. A check on Aladin shows no hint of either of the    .       
                       new companions. It appears that Baranov may have accidentally merged    .       
                       his measure of H 6 26 with measures of the nearby pair 19394+1634 =     .       
                       H N 84. His 29.2" measure agrees with other measures of that pair, and  .       
                       a star in the field of H N  84 (V=11.9) matches his wide pair.          .       
                       H 6 26AD has therefore been X-coded. Since the identification with      .       
                       H N 84 is likely but not definite (and since the 12th magnitude star    .       
                       near H N 84 appears to be a random field star), Baranov's measures      .       
                       have not been added.  Thanks to Steve Smith and John Nanson for         .

                       A new 2+2 quadruple system. The outer 17" binary HJ 1535 AB has been    .        
                       known since 1828 (Herschel 1831). If B were a background star, the PM   HJ_1831  
                       of A, 0".208/y, would have moved it by 38" in 185 yr. The pair AB is    .        
                       therefore undoubtedly physical. The discrepant PM of B reported in      .        
                       the WDS could be caused by the subsystem Ba,Bb discovered here. The A   .        
                       component has an astrometric subsystem Aa,Ab with P = 3.9 yr (Goldin    .        
                       & Makarov 2007), confirmed spectroscopically by D. Latham. The B        Gln2007  
                       component was tentatively resolved by Robo-AO, but was thought to be    .        
                       too uncertain to publish in Riddle et al. (2015). Now Ba,Bb is          RAO2015  
                       clearly resolved at 0".17. Its estimated period is ~30 yr. The field    .        
                       is extremely crowded and another faint star E is detected at 12".1      .        
                       from A by both Robo-AO and PALM-3000. Comparison with 2MASS shows       .        
                       relative motion opposite to PM(A), so AE is optical.                    Rbr2015d

                       This system counts as single in our statistics, even though it appears  .       
                       to be a triple system in reality. The reason for this is that the A     .       
                       component was the AstraLux target, and the BC pair at ~7.8" is outside  .       
                       of the completeness cut-off at 6". Since the BC pair is visible in the  .       
                       AstraLux images, we can nonetheless analyze it astrometrically. This    .       
                       pair was first reported by Beuzit et al. (2004) with rho = 0.978" and   .       
                       theta = 305.8deg. There are no error bars quoted, but if we assume      .       
                       that the quoted precision in decimal places corresponds to measurement  .       
                       precision, and adopt errors of 5 mas and 0.5deg, which should be        .       
                       conservative in that circumstance, we find that common proper motion    .       
                       can be confirmed at a 76 sigma confidence level. Hence, physical        .
