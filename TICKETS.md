# Checklist of changes to be made:

### Other new methods
Overall things:
* figure out which units everything should be in
* create methods for conversion

## Create PDF view/creation for:
* DSOs
* ObservingLocation
* Observation?  
    * This would just be a printable form.
    * Fill in things like ObservingLocation metadata, date, etc.
    * At some point add in metadata for photography...
* Planets
* Overview
    * Somehow figure out a subset of DSOs
        * maybe have PlotView create a second form to select DSOs to add to the Overview?
        * short-hand observing form?  (which things in the list did get observed?)

## Environment
* Create ability to set "dark mode" on server startup.
    * Change global style/CSS to support this.
